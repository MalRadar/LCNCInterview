# An Exploratory Interview Study of End-User LLM Agent Development Practices

## README

This repository contains materials from a qualitative study examining how non-expert users develop LLM-based agents using low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms. Through semi-structured interviews, we explored participantsâ€™ development processes, challenges, and needs to inform future design of more supportive and inclusive development tools.
