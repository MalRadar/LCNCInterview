2. **Criteria for completion**  
   - How did you know when the agent was “done”?  
   - What were your standards for saying it met your needs?  
   - Was there a point where it suddenly felt “smart” or usable? What changed?

3. **Time and effort**  
   - Roughly how much time and effort did you spend?  
   - How was your time distributed across different steps?  
   - Which part was most time- or energy-consuming (e.g., prompt writing, UI design, workflow setup)?

4. **Challenges**  
   - What challenges did you encounter during development?  
   - Were there moments you didn’t know what to do or couldn’t proceed?  
   - How did those challenges affect your process?  
   - Did you reflect on the causes of those challenges?  
   - What was the biggest or most impactful challenge?

5. **Problem-solving**  
   - How did you solve those issues?  
   - Did anyone help you, or did you figure it out on your own?  
   - How difficult were these to solve?  
   - Are there still unsolved or hard-to-solve challenges?  
   - Were there any features you gave up on? Why?  
   - Were there any features added spontaneously during development?

6. **Learning curve**  
   - Did you receive any prior training on this or similar platforms?  
   - What was the learning curve like?  
   - Which parts were intuitive, and which were confusing?  
   - What improvements could make it easier for ordinary users?

7. **Platform experience**  
   - What was your overall impression of using the no-code platform?  
   - What did you like or dislike? Any suggestions?  
   - Were there any “wow” moments (e.g., doing something big with a single prompt)?  
   - Were there any moments that felt frustrating or unintuitive?

8. **Other platforms**  
   - Have you used any similar platforms (e.g., Coze)?  
   - How did they compare?

9. **Reflections and learning**  
   - Has your understanding of AI agents or applications changed?  
   - Did you learn new concepts (e.g., prompt engineering, UI design, data structures)?  
   - If you were to do the project again, what would you change?

10. **Future expectations**  
    - What is your attitude toward AI agent platforms—positive, neutral, or negative?  
    - What capabilities do you hope these platforms will support in the future?  
    - Do you see yourself using them again?  
    - Do you think more everyday users will create AI tools this way?  
    - How might these platforms impact our learning, work, or life?  
    - Do you have any concerns about the democratization of AI agent development? Why?

11. **Final thoughts**  
    - Is there anything else you’d like to share about your AI agent development experience?
